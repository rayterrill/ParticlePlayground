# Particle Giant Button Project

I wanted to build a simple project that allowed me to mount a giant button to an internet-connected board as an example of what
could be done with IOT projects. I chose the Particle Photon for price and simplicity, and a giant button from Adafruit.

Fritzing diagram and code included. The one thing to note is that the Adafruit giant button includes two more connections to drive
the button's built-in LED - I have those connected as well, to D6 and the GROUND rail.
